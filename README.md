# SmartEstatePriceML 🤖🏠

📌 **Overview**

SmartEstatePriceML is a machine learning project that predicts real estate prices using two powerful models: Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. This repository provides a robust approach for analyzing housing market trends and making accurate predictions.

🚀 **Features**
- Utilizes real-world data (Diabetes dataset simulated for house prices)
- Compares two powerful models: Random Forest and XGBoost
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
- Execution time analysis for model training and prediction
- Visual analysis with actual vs predicted house prices

🏗 **Tech Stack**

📊 **Model Performance**

After training the models, we compare their performance based on MSE and R² Score:

| Model           | MSE (Lower is Better) | R² Score (Higher is Better) |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Random Forest   | XX.XXXX                | X.XXXX                      |
| XGBoost         | XX.XXXX                | X.XXXX                      |

📌 **Note:** Replace `XX.XXXX` with actual results after execution.

🖼 **Visualizing Predictions**

The project provides scatter plots comparing actual vs predicted values for better insights. Example:
